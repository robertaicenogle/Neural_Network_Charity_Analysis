## Written Analysis
Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

Results:
- Using bulleted lists and images to support your answers, address the following questions.
  - There is a bulleted list that answers all six questions

- Data Preprocessing
- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model?
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data?

- Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and explain your recommendation.

- There is a summary of the results
- There is a recommendation on using a different model to solve the classification problem, and justification
